                This is a sturdy-designed cup on top of a frilled saucer. The cup is 8 cm in diameter and 8.5 cm tall.
                The cup has a 4.225 cm long handle, making the cup 12.225 cm at the longest. The saucer is 16 cm wide in diameter. The cup and saucer
                are each one solidworks part each, as such, many planes were used for the cup and handle attachment.
                <br>
                The cup's handle is inspired from springs and the saucer expresses some juxtaposition.
