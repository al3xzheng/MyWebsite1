                This is a traditional trampoline design. The top of the mat is exactly 1 metre off the ground. The circular orientation of the legs of the trampoline and
                the making of the springs were the most difficult. The clipping network that connects the spring to mat was not difficult but time consuming.
                I am very proud on my trampoline design as it is very sleek and clean, and inspired by my own trampoline.

                The springs hold the mat in place for bounce.
