                This is a 4 legged chair with a seat that is 18 inches from the ground. It is 4 feet tall in total. The design was not inspired by anything
                and was created from free-form creativity. I am proud of this design as it was my first solidworks project that I finished and I worked on it with my sister.
                I learned a lot from this project, especially on the joy, capabilities, and problem-solving involved with SolidWorks and CAD.
                <br>
                The bottom of the chair is still a work in progress.
