                This is the To-Scale AirBus A380 aircraft. Following the schematic (right) on the airplane, I have modelled the aircraft.
                You can see the fuselage, the belly, the wing, and the vertical stabilizer. The other wing and horizontal stabilizer are still in progress.
                This project really expanded my horizons on the capabilities of SolidWorks. I have really dialed in my skills in SolidWorks and learned how to use pierce, 
                project curves, convert entities, loft, and much more. This project was a grind, but worth it; a highlight was when creating the fuselage and belly, where I really enjoyed using
                math and ratios to shape out the shapes to loft. This required some thought, and especially on the belly, where the bottom is horizontal.
                Long story short, I am satisfied on the shaping of the aircraft. This project aimed to reinforce, dial in, and expand my SolidWorks skillset. I am
                super excited on what I can create next!

                The stabilizers, the other wing, and the aethetics windows are still a work in progress.
