            This is the website you are currently on. <br><br>

            This is the FIRST iteration of my "personal" website. It was created in late December
            of 2023 after my 1a term of University. The goal of this website is to provide some aesthetic appeal, but primarily to express
            my projects, with the aesthetics coming later. As you can see, I have SOLIDWORKS and coding projects, which I will grow. This website
            was solely created with HTML/CSS. It is very basic (which is evident)!
