                This is a ceramic through-hole capacitor I designed with the maximum capacitance of a 3 digit capacitor code. Although simple, yet sleek, it was relatively
                tricky to design given how seemingly trivial it is.
                <br>
                Due to my interest in Hardware, I was inspired to design and create this such that I could 3-d print it and keep it as a collectible. It was 3-d printed using
                its g-code and Cura.
